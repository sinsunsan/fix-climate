# Natural Retroaction Effects

* **Clouds may disappear** passing 1000 ppm of GES \(in 100 years with current emission rate\) and increase the 4°C at that time by 8°C equaling 12°C which would be similar to the conditions of the warmest temperature life have experienced in earth called PEPM [https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/)
* **Permafrost melting :** Permafrost contain a lot of methane which is a much more powerful Greenhouse Gaz \(GHG\) and have the potential to equal amount of CO2 already in atmosphere.
* **Albedo change** : Ice melting change earth [Albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) \(reflection coefficient of sun light\) so more heath will be absorbed by ocean \(blue have a less reflective coefficient than ice\)
* **Forest and trees decrease** : many trees will not withstand the temperature augmentation and will die, deforestation on the other way is year after year reducing the surface occupied by forest. And forest in a carbon well! So Carbon not absorbed by forest will remain in thee atmosphere
* **Methane** contained in Arctic ice releasing
